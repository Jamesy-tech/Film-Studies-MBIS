In what ways does The Lion King depict (show) the struggle between good and evil
through its symbolism and use of light and darkness?

The Lion King shows symbolism and the use of light and darkness by changing
the lighting in different scenes, depending on what is going on.
For example, if a sad scene is happening, the lighting might change to a more
dark or red-ish colour. Other uses of lighting include creating depth,
improving the atmosphere, or guiding the viewer's attention within the movie.

    [2] = [[

Another way The Lion King shows symbolism between good and evil is through
the Pride Lands (light) versus the Elephant Graveyard (dark). The light areas
represent safety, life, and order, while the dark areas represent danger,
destruction, and evil.
